I wrote this Wiki a while ago when I got fed up of the multitude of Wiki clones that used non-standard syntax or just
looked too complicated.

* Basically uses Markdown
* Uses Portland WikiWords for internal links (None of this [[brackets non-sense]])
* Simple for first time Wiki users
* Renaming pages also renames all references to the page
* Dashboard shows recent changes
* History shows recently viewed pages
* File uploads (S3)
* View old versions of pages

Status & To Do
--------------

* Recently upgraded to Rails 3
* File uploads needs tidying up
* Quick ref needs adding back in
* Will add quick edit & save modes (e.g. click on text and CTRL+ENTER in textarea to save)
* Might add image support
* Another UI Rework using jQuery UI
* Email notification of page changes
* Need to make deployment easier
