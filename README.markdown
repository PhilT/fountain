I wrote this wiki a while ago when I got fed up of the multitude of Wiki clones that used non-standard syntax or just looked too complicated. I wanted one that supported the original Portland repository syntax but looked a little nicer and was easy for beginners to get into (e.g. had a key for wiki syntax within easy reach).

* Basically uses Markdown. None of this [[brackets non-sense]]. Supports WikiWords
* Simple for first time Wiki users
* Rename titles and see the renames in all links

After needing something similar at work recently I decided to dust it off and maybe add a few features
