Assert Valid XHTML
==================

This is an offline replacement for the assert_valid_xhtml assertion from
Codahale's responsible_markup plugin, at:

http://blog.codahale.com/2006/03/05/responsiblemarkup-v01-unit-test-your-way-to-responsible-markup/

See the blog post I wrote about this at:

http://www.jandaweb.com/blog_posts/7

In short, you need the libxml-ruby gem.

I apologise if I broke any rules about distributing the DTDs.


Example
=======

get :show
assert_response :success
assert_valid_xhtml


Lots of love,
